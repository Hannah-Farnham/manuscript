Hello World, 

My name is Hannah Farnham and I created this website to highlight the first chapter in Bruno Munari's book, "Design as Art." The color (primary) and fonts (sans-serif geometric) are reminisent of the Bauhaus movement, which is mentioned within the chapter. The Bauhaus Manifesto has a similar notion to this chapter as well.
